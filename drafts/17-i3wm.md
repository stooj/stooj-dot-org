Title: Installing a Window Manager: i3wm edition
Date: 2024-11-17T19:50:08
Category: NixOS

Time to turn this server into a workstation. I'm planning on (finally) making the switch to wayland soon, but for now I'm going to get my old favourite i3wm up and running.

```bash
cd ~/code/nix/nix-config
git checkout -b i3wm
```

Using the [wiki page for i3](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/I3):

<!-- TODO Link to commit 692448f -->

I've just followed the wiki exactly, even though I'm not that into i3gaps. I'll get it working first, then I can get it right.

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
reboot
```

Reboot the laptop, and I get a graphical login screen. And I can log in :)

[According to the wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/I3#I3-gaps_fork), I also need to set the global i3 package to i3-gaps to use i3-gaps.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 04a1ed3 -->

OK, time to get i3wm working just so. First thing to fix is the keybindings, which inexplicably suffer from an off-by-one error (`jkl;` instead of `hjkl`).

<!-- TODO Link to commit 5be5a12 -->

🥴 There are some new things here. First of all, I'm including `config` and `lib` in the "inputs" (?) here because I'm going to need them for this change.

Then I'm declaring a variable called `modifier` that will only exist for the scope of this configuration block (the bit between the `{ }`s). This is in case I change `Modifier = Mod4` on line 46 <!-- TODO Add permalink to line --> to something else I only have to change it in the one place.

Finally, I'm using `mkOptionDefault` to say "I don't want to replace ALL the default keybindings", just add/replace these ones.

Unfortunately, the `focus left` keybind (which is sensible) overwrites the `split h` keybind for splitting horizontally. I use `o`, as in "I'm from London and I want an Orizontal split!"

<!-- TODO Link to commit 42595bd -->

Of course, I want the "move windows around" keys to be the same as the "focus windows around" keys:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 7099837 -->

I've used capitals here, but as far as I know it's case-insensitive so just to visually indicate that it's a shifted character.

But... if Shift+h is H, then isn't Shift+H just h? Or is it H not matter how many shifts there are? Does it really matter?

No.

Onward.

i3 can do this thing where you "pin" a floating window and it will appear on every workspace. It's quite handy for zoom meetings you're only ½ paying attention to or videos you're only ⅛ paying attention to.

<!-- TODO Link to commit a7da8c1 -->

That's the i3-only keybindings done. Time to add binds for resizing windows.
i3 uses the arrow keys by default for resize mode and moves them by 10 pixels at a time. So small! I add an additional set of resize keys using vim keys with bigger moves. That way I can gross-move windows with the home row and then fine-tune their position with the arrow keys if I need to.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 2941877 -->

Hmm. When I switch to my new generation (`sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .`) that doesn't work. 🤔 The resize `hjkl` keybindings don't do anything.

Time to figure out how to diff the current and previous version of a configuration file manually. I know there are tools to do this, but they work during the `nixos-rebuild switch`, not after the fact.

I found [this matrix thread](https://matrix.to/#/!YllBCgVdcoakoavZvX:rycee.net/$II37cqwnYVwmOYZlqwESqtdvHvwe2r_DvXzi69OROGk?via=matrix.org&via=tchncs.de&via=envs.net) and I hope the link still works in 20 years time.

The current generation can be found in `~/.local/state/home-manager/gcroots/current-home` and the previous generations can be found in `~/.local/state/nix/profiles/`.

Actually, **all** the generations can be found in `~/.local/state/nix/profiles` and `~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager` resolves to be the same place as `~/.local/state/home-manager/gcroots/current-home`:

```bash
ls -l ~/.local/state/home-manager/gcroots/ && ls -l ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/
```

```

```

My current generation is #8 at `/nix/store/4dbpvnvhy5s25hxp5dc6ggxxm5bj9ydb-home-manager-generation` and the previous generation is presumably #7 at `/nix/store/xm5kkb1ndi8f6ci3gccr4cy5syb6gs13-home-manager-generation`.

Time to diff them. LHS is previous (working) generation, RHS is current (not working) generation.
Here's the default on the left (which works) and here's the not default on the right (which doesn't work). My `mkOptionDefault` thing doesn't work for this either 🤷

```bash
diff --side-by-side \
  --suppress-common-lines \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager-7-link/home-files/.config/i3/config \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager/home-files/.config/i3/config
```

```
  bindsym Down resize grow height 10 px or 10 ppt             |   bindsym Mod4+r mode default
  bindsym Escape mode default                                 |   bindsym h resize shrink width 50 px or 50 ppt
  bindsym Left resize shrink width 10 px or 10 ppt            |   bindsym j resize grow height 50 px or 50 ppt
  bindsym Return mode default                                 |   bindsym k resize shrink height 50 px or 50 ppt
  bindsym Right resize grow width 10 px or 10 ppt             |   bindsym l resize grow width 50 px or 50 ppt
  bindsym Up resize shrink height 10 px or 10 ppt             <
```

First thing to note is that my grand plan to keep the defaults didn't work. There are `defaults` declared in [the source](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/8cf9cb2ee78aa129e5b8220135a511a2be254c0c/modules/services/window-managers/i3-sway/i3.nix#L114), but they don't use `mapAttrs mkOptionDefault` like the [keybindings option does](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/8cf9cb2ee78aa129e5b8220135a511a2be254c0c/modules/services/window-managers/i3-sway/i3.nix#L23). I know how to fix that - I just need to declare all the binds. So why aren't `hjkl` working? They look **the same**, right? Apart from the 10/50 and the keyboard key.

Let's pick one cardinal direction and line up the working and not-working config and compare them (adding some padding so everything lines up correctly):

```
bindsym Down resize grow height 10 px or 10 ppt
bindsym j    resize grow height 50 px or 50 ppt
```

<!-- TODO Insert gif of total confusion -->

OK, new tack. Let's try replacing the default with the default and check that works:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 529af9f -->

Rebuild and test... That all works perfectly. And 10 pixels is actually quite a lot; 50 was way too big. But change one variable at a time.

<!-- TODO Link to commit b02114e -->

Add one new bind, rebuild and test.

And it works.

<!-- TODO Insert gif of my brain hurts -->

Add in the other three direction binds:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 1837a99 -->

Rebuild and test. Aaaand it works fine.

Maybe it was the key chord?

<!-- TODO Link to commit 9e96f8b -->

Check that changed things as expected:

```bash
diff \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager-11-link/home-files/.config/i3/config \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager/home-files/.config/i3/config
```

```
78a79
>   bindsym Mod4+r mode default
```

Looks good. And if I spam the `metakey + r` I jump in and out of resize mode.

Maybe it was using the variable for the modifier that did it?

<!-- TODO Link to commit 6164b44 -->

Still working perfectly.

Running out of things to try. How about going back to (what I now realise is an unreasonable) 50 px.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 1b46666 -->

It works and I don't know why it didn't before.

<!-- TODO Insert gif of someone sobbing uncontrollably -->

Right! MAXIMUM SIZE!

<!-- TODO Link to commit 7b7864f -->

Oh smeg off. Still working? Mind you, it's only _kinda_ working - if the window is < 50 wide you can't make it smaller. Was that all that was wrong the first time? I would feel a right silly sausage if that was it.

Just for fun, I'm going to add the (apparently not useful in this case) `mkOptionDefault` bit again.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 3f63f50 -->

And do a diff to compare with that old broken version from so long ago:

```bash
diff --side-by-side \
  --suppress-common-lines \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager-8-link/home-files/.config/i3/config \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager/home-files/.config/i3/config
```

```
                                                              >   bindsym Down resize grow height 10 px or 10 ppt
                                                              >   bindsym Escape mode default
                                                              >   bindsym Left resize shrink width 10 px or 10 ppt
                                                              >   bindsym Return mode default
                                                              >   bindsym Right resize grow width 10 px or 10 ppt
                                                              >   bindsym Up resize shrink height 10 px or 10 ppt
```

And it still works, and the only difference with the broken version is the defaults I re-added. Maybe it was working but I was testing with too many windows so none of them could move 50 pixels in any direction?

Anyway, time to re-remove that cruft that's bound to confuse me in future, and adjust the increments to something more useful.

<!-- TODO Link to commit b1d7a59 -->

I like the bar to be on the top rather than the bottom. I'm probably going to switch it out with polybar, but that's a tomorrow problem.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 2a73021 -->

Again there's not "keep the defaults" for bars, so I've got to replicate all of the [default configuration](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/8cf9cb2ee78aa129e5b8220135a511a2be254c0c/modules/services/window-managers/i3-sway/lib/options.nix#L708).

Actually, I don't need the colour configuration for the bar. Get it out of there, I have different plans.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 3e6efda -->

For some reason, i3 is defaulting to workspace 10 when it starts. Fixiefix.

<!-- TODO Link to commit afc4fc1 -->

I love rofi as a launcher; it looks pretty, it's extendable and other people have made the extensions I want, and has fuzzy matching. And it has a `pass` integration that you can directly configure in home-manager.

It needs to be enabled in home-manager and set to the i3 menu.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 5d0d15b -->

Rofi needs to be told what mode to use as well, hence the `-show run`.

I also like a run dialog that exposes desktop files, so adding a keybinding for that:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 23ebf1d -->

There are other modes apart from `run` and `drun` like `ssh` but for the life of me I have never ever remembered to use them, so I'm not going to bother.

I **do** use the emoji picker though, but it probably needs a font. Good excuse to learn how to add fonts. I have already added the package back in commit 5d0d15bd which breaks the 4th wall a bit, but changing history in git is hard so live with it.

<!-- TODO Link to commit c757823 -->

Huh, it doesn't work because it can't find the emoji plugin.

<!-- TODO Insert image
17-i3wm-rofi_emoji_not_working.png
-->

Huh. It works if I run it from the terminal though by just typing `rofi -show emoji -modi emoji`

<!-- TODO Insert image
17-i3wm-rofi_emoji_working_from_terminal.png
-->

Oh, I know what's probably happening.

When I run `rofi` in a terminal, where does the binary actually live?

```bash
readlink --canonicalize $(which rofi)
```

```
/nix/store/79mg7q26xmz0j4skrimvbxbjqa52bqz0-rofi-1.7.5/bin/rofi
```

And where is the binary that is in the config?

```bash
grep "rofi -show emoji" ~/.config/i3/config
```

```
bindsym Mod4+Shift+S exec /nix/store/75yih3xb71rf7aifs3sbzwcp4bmd8sks-rofi-1.7.5/bin/rofi -show emoji -modi emoji
```

Those hashes are not the same. So `${pkgs.rofi}` is the system installation of `rofi`, not the home-manager one with plugins included.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 6e47c5d -->

What is this nonsense? I lifted it from the [services.emacs.package](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-services.emacs.package) docs, but it's saying "if rofi is enabled in home-manager, use that package, otherwise use the nixpkgs version".

Should probably do the same for the `menu` option:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 543d30f -->

I find the default "exit i3" menu to be annoying because it commits the sin of making me use a mouse. Nope. I have a rofi replacement; I don't remember where I got it which is my bad but it's lovely. Fuzzy matching and pretty.

<!-- TODO Link to commit bf30fb7 -->

Things are looking pretty good for a base "i3" configuration from which to build. There's a few things still missing though, like notifications. That's easy, use [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/).

<!-- TODO Link to commit 360478a -->

Now that it's installed, I can apply the flake (`sudo nixos-rebuild --flake .`) and have a look at the directory tree to figure out where things are (probably in the `bin/` directory)

Oops. There's a typo first. Fixfixfix

<!-- TODO Link to commit 295053c -->

Where was I?

```bash
readlink --canonicalize $(which dunstctl)
```

```
/nix/store/rn37a2vii9bkmbkj06s325g46yxd2k8y-dunst-1.11.0/bin/dunstctl
```

Cool, it's just in `bin/` of the dunst derivation. Add some keybindings for it in the i3 config:

<!-- TODO Link to commit bacb92b -->

And I can test them:

```bash
nix-shell --packages libnotify
notify-send "You see a tortoise crawling toward you"
notify-send "Know what a turtle is?" "Same thing"
notify-send "They're just questions"
logout
```

Cool. That's it! ~~There's plenty still to do~~ Oh no, wait! There's one really important thing I need to change.

Disable mouse focus
While I find focus-follows-mouse essential with desktop environments, it gets in the way when you are selected all focus using the keyboard.

For example, I will ask rofi-pass to type into a terminal, but in the time it takes to open rofi-pass and find what I want, focus has switched to wherever mymouse is pointing (often the wrong place).

<!-- TODO Link to commit f0e679b -->

And that's it! That's all I want to muck about with i3 just now. Merge time!

```bash
cd ~/code/nix/nix-config
git checkout main
git merge i3wm
```
