Title: Installing a Window Manager: i3wm edition
Date: 2024-11-17T19:50:08
Category: NixOS

Time to turn this server into a workstation. I'm planning on (finally) making the switch to wayland soon, but for now I'm going to get my old favourite i3wm up and running.

```bash
cd ~/code/nix/nix-config
git checkout -b i3wm
```

Using the [wiki page for i3](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/I3):

<!-- TODO Link to commit 692448f -->

I've just followed the wiki exactly, even though I'm not that into i3gaps. I'll get it working first, then I can get it right.

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
reboot
```

Reboot the laptop, and I get a graphical login screen. And I can log in :)

[According to the wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/I3#I3-gaps_fork), I also need to set the global i3 package to i3-gaps to use i3-gaps.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 04a1ed3 -->

OK, time to get i3wm working just so. First thing to fix is the keybindings, which inexplicably suffer from an off-by-one error (`jkl;` instead of `hjkl`).

<!-- TODO Link to commit 5be5a12 -->

ðŸ¥´ There are some new things here. First of all, I'm including `config` and `lib` in the "inputs" (?) here because I'm going to need them for this change.

Then I'm declaring a variable called `modifier` that will only exist for the scope of this configuration block (the bit between the `{ }`s). This is in case I change `Modifier = Mod4` on line 46 <!-- TODO Add permalink to line --> to something else I only have to change it in the one place.

Finally, I'm using `mkOptionDefault` to say "I don't want to replace ALL the default keybindings", just add/replace these ones.

Unfortunately, the `focus left` keybind (which is sensible) overwrites the `split h` keybind for splitting horizontally. I use `o`, as in "I'm from London and I want an Orizontal split!"

<!-- TODO Link to commit 42595bd -->

Of course, I want the "move windows around" keys to be the same as the "focus windows around" keys:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 7099837 -->

I've used capitals here, but as far as I know it's case-insensitive so just to visually indicate that it's a shifted character.

But... if Shift+h is H, then isn't Shift+H just h? Or is it H not matter how many shifts there are? Does it really matter?

No.

Onward.

i3 can do this thing where you "pin" a floating window and it will appear on every workspace. It's quite handy for zoom meetings you're only Â½ paying attention to or videos you're only â…› paying attention to.

<!-- TODO Link to commit a7da8c1 -->

That's the i3-only keybindings done. Time to add binds for resizing windows.
i3 uses the arrow keys by default for resize mode and moves them by 10 pixels at a time. So small! I add an additional set of resize keys using vim keys with bigger moves. That way I can gross-move windows with the home row and then fine-tune their position with the arrow keys if I need to.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 2941877 -->

Hmm. When I switch to my new generation (`sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .`) that doesn't work. ðŸ¤” The resize `hjkl` keybindings don't do anything.

Time to figure out how to diff the current and previous version of a configuration file manually. I know there are tools to do this, but they work during the `nixos-rebuild switch`, not after the fact.

I found [this matrix thread](https://matrix.to/#/!YllBCgVdcoakoavZvX:rycee.net/$II37cqwnYVwmOYZlqwESqtdvHvwe2r_DvXzi69OROGk?via=matrix.org&via=tchncs.de&via=envs.net) and I hope the link still works in 20 years time.

The current generation can be found in `~/.local/state/home-manager/gcroots/current-home` and the previous generations can be found in `~/.local/state/nix/profiles/`.

Actually, **all** the generations can be found in `~/.local/state/nix/profiles` and `~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager` resolves to be the same place as `~/.local/state/home-manager/gcroots/current-home`:

```bash
ls -l ~/.local/state/home-manager/gcroots/ && ls -l ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/
```

```

```

My current generation is #8 at `/nix/store/4dbpvnvhy5s25hxp5dc6ggxxm5bj9ydb-home-manager-generation` and the previous generation is presumably #7 at `/nix/store/xm5kkb1ndi8f6ci3gccr4cy5syb6gs13-home-manager-generation`.

Time to diff them. LHS is previous (working) generation, RHS is current (not working) generation.
Here's the default on the left (which works) and here's the not default on the right (which doesn't work). My `mkOptionDefault` thing doesn't work for this either ðŸ¤·

```bash
diff --side-by-side \
  --suppress-common-lines \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager-7-link/home-files/.config/i3/config \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager/home-files/.config/i3/config
```

```
  bindsym Down resize grow height 10 px or 10 ppt             |   bindsym Mod4+r mode default
  bindsym Escape mode default                                 |   bindsym h resize shrink width 50 px or 50 ppt
  bindsym Left resize shrink width 10 px or 10 ppt            |   bindsym j resize grow height 50 px or 50 ppt
  bindsym Return mode default                                 |   bindsym k resize shrink height 50 px or 50 ppt
  bindsym Right resize grow width 10 px or 10 ppt             |   bindsym l resize grow width 50 px or 50 ppt
  bindsym Up resize shrink height 10 px or 10 ppt             <
```

First thing to note is that my grand plan to keep the defaults didn't work. There are `defaults` declared in [the source](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/8cf9cb2ee78aa129e5b8220135a511a2be254c0c/modules/services/window-managers/i3-sway/i3.nix#L114), but they don't use `mapAttrs mkOptionDefault` like the [keybindings option does](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/8cf9cb2ee78aa129e5b8220135a511a2be254c0c/modules/services/window-managers/i3-sway/i3.nix#L23). I know how to fix that - I just need to declare all the binds. So why aren't `hjkl` working? They look **the same**, right? Apart from the 10/50 and the keyboard key.

Let's pick one cardinal direction and line up the working and not-working config and compare them (adding some padding so everything lines up correctly):

```
bindsym Down resize grow height 10 px or 10 ppt
bindsym j    resize grow height 50 px or 50 ppt
```

<!-- TODO Insert gif of total confusion -->

OK, new tack. Let's try replacing the default with the default and check that works:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 529af9f -->

Rebuild and test... That all works perfectly. And 10 pixels is actually quite a lot; 50 was way too big. But change one variable at a time.

<!-- TODO Link to commit b02114e -->

Add one new bind, rebuild and test.

And it works.

<!-- TODO Insert gif of my brain hurts -->

Add in the other three direction binds:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 1837a99 -->

Rebuild and test. Aaaand it works fine.

Maybe it was the key chord?

<!-- TODO Link to commit 9e96f8b -->

Check that changed things as expected:

```bash
diff \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager-11-link/home-files/.config/i3/config \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager/home-files/.config/i3/config
```

```
78a79
>   bindsym Mod4+r mode default
```

Looks good. And if I spam the `metakey + r` I jump in and out of resize mode.

Maybe it was using the variable for the modifier that did it?

<!-- TODO Link to commit 6164b44 -->

Still working perfectly.

Running out of things to try. How about going back to (what I now realise is an unreasonable) 50 px.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 1b46666 -->

It works and I don't know why it didn't before.

<!-- TODO Insert gif of someone sobbing uncontrollably -->

Right! MAXIMUM SIZE!

<!-- TODO Link to commit 7b7864f -->

Oh smeg off. Mind you, it's only _kinda_ working - if the window is < 50 wide you can't make it smaller. Was that all that was wrong the first time? I would feel a right silly sausage if that was it.

Just for fun, I'm going to add the (apparently not useful in this case) `mkOptionDefault` bit again.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 3f63f50 -->

And do a diff to compare with that old broken version from so long ago:

```bash
diff --side-by-side \
  --suppress-common-lines \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager-8-link/home-files/.config/i3/config \
  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager/home-files/.config/i3/config
```

```
                                                              >   bindsym Down resize grow height 10 px or 10 ppt
                                                              >   bindsym Escape mode default
                                                              >   bindsym Left resize shrink width 10 px or 10 ppt
                                                              >   bindsym Return mode default
                                                              >   bindsym Right resize grow width 10 px or 10 ppt
                                                              >   bindsym Up resize shrink height 10 px or 10 ppt
```

And it still works, and the only difference with the broken version is the defaults I re-added. Maybe it was working but I was testing with too many windows so none of them could move 50 pixels in any direction?

Anyway, time to re-remove that cruft that's bound to confuse me in future, and adjust the increments to something more useful.
