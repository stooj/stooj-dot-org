Screenshots are currently handled with Flameshot. Pictures are saved in `$HOME/pictures/screenshots`.

Take a screenshot of the entire current display (workspace):
    `PrintScreen`

Let me draw a box around an area and then give me a UI to mess about with the image (draw arrows, reisze, etc):
    `Mod4 + PrintScreen`

Give me a 5 second countdown and then let me draw a box around an area etc:
    `Mod4 + Shift + PrintScreen`
