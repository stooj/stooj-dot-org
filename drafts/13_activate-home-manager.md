Title: Activate Home Manager

As usual, start with my TODO list:

At the end of the OS installation, we had two TODO lists to check:

- [x] Switch to flakes
- [ ] User configuration files
- [x] Secrets
- [ ] More system packages (like a working desktop)
- [ ] User secrets
- [ ] Full disk encryption

We also had a list of things to add to the configuration:

- [x] Disk partitioning and formatting (needs flakes âœ“)
- [x] Root user password (needs secrets âœ“)
- [x] Wireless network connection details for `rentalflat` (needs secrets âœ“)
- [x] Passwords for `pindy` and `stooj` (needs secrets âœ“)
- [ ] SSH known hosts file maybe. (needs user configuration âœ—)
- [ ] `/home/stooj/code/nix/` directory (needs user configuration âœ—)
- [ ] `/home/stooj/code/nix/nix-config` cloned from GitHab or whatever (needs
      user configuration âœ—)
- [ ] Git user configuration (needs user configuration âœ—)
- [ ] GPG pubring (needs user configuration âœ—)

My laptop still isn't particulary useful yet, but I'm still in the bootstrap
phase which involves ticking off all the items above ðŸ‘†, and the biggest-impact
change looks like User Configuration.

The way of managing user configuration files with Nix is using [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#ch-introduction).
It lets you reproduce the configuration of a home directory (say `/home/stooj`).

What baffles me is that the official installation instructions include adding a
nix channel, which **is a stateful thing to do**! It's not part of the
configuration stored in the git repo so it won't get applied when I recreate the
system. This feels pretty anti-patternish to me.

You can add it to the flake as well though, which is "the right wayâ„¢" if you ask
me.

Here's how:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 94f2370 -->

The `follows` here (and in the sops configuration) means "keep in sync with
nixpkgs", presumably in case `release-24.05` drifts from `nixos-24.05`.

Out of the box, home-manager uses it's own instance of `pkgs`, but I want it to
use the system pkgs rather than a per-user copy. It's faster.

<!-- TODO Link to commit fb1f23a -->

The other thing home-manager does is put all the installed packages into
`$HOME/.nix-profile`. That's fine by me, but according to the [docs](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#sec-install-nixos-module)
it breaks building VMs, which is probably going to be handy in the future. So
time to change it so packages get installed in `/etc/profiles/per-user/stooj`.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 05d078b -->

Next it's time to add user configurations for stooj and pindy. I'm splitting
each user into a separate file, and this commit is just boiler plate "turn
things on" stuff.

<!-- TODO Link to commit d3fdb4c -->

It'll start a couple of systemd services:

- home-manager-pindy.service
- home-manager-stooj.service
- nix-daemon.service

`nix-daemon` runs build tasks and other stuff on behalf of unprivileged users,
which seems pretty important for managing user configurations.

I'm a bit hazy on this next step - this option is nested **inside** the user's
configuration, so do I need to set it for each user? Or do I only need to set it
once? I guess home-manager is installed for each user, so it needs to be set for
each user.

Anyway, this option tells home-manager to install and manage itself.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 2fb3885 -->

Woah. That was easy. And the options are [many and varied](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml).

- [x] Switch to flakes
- [x] User configuration files
- [x] Secrets
- [ ] More system packages (like a working desktop)
- [ ] User secrets

Time to tick off some more things.
