Where was that list of things to add to the configuration?

- [ ] Disk partitioning and formatting
- [ ] Root user password
- [ ] Wireless network connection details for `rentalflat`
- [ ] Passwords for `pindy` and `stooj`
- [ ] SSH known hosts file maybe.
- [ ] `/home/stooj/code/nix/` directory
- [ ] `/home/stooj/code/nix/nix-config` cloned from GitHab or whatever

We've *kinda* done the first one, but I still want to prod it a little. No
encryption yet.
