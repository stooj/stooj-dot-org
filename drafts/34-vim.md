```bash
cd ~/code/nix/nix-config
git checkout -b vim
```

This is going to be a big one.

A couple of posts ago I mucked around getting a single plugin installed in the system configuration of vim. It was a bit of a footer and I'd like to leave `root`s vim as plain as possible for security & performance reasons; if I'm using vim as root something has gone wrong somewhere and I'm in crisis mode.

My _user_ vim configuration is a different matter, though. I want two configurations; my standard full-blown bells-and-whistles all-singing-all-dancing basically-an-ide vim configuration for workstations, and then a subset of plugins and configuration for use on servers. On a workstation the configuration should also apply to the gui version of vim. Oh, and it's going to be neovim rather than vim.

My plan is not to _completely_ finish my vim configuration but at least get a nice system that can be easily added to in future.

Neovim has a respectable set of configuration options in [home manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-programs.neovim.enable), but the configuration would still end up being a lot of vim script or lua shoved into nix's [multi-line strings](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/language/values#type-string). And there is another project out there.

[NixVim - A Neovim configuration system for nix](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/)

Installation first. It's accessible as a flake ([docs](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/24.11/user-guide/install.html)).

<!-- TODO Link to commit 1c94a4e -->

Then update the flake.lock file with:

```bash
nix flake update
```

This updates the `flake.lock` file:

So `vim` isn't going to be the system default any more. :thinking: I want it as the default for the _root_ user, and pindy will probably want something else, so [line 5 of `vim.nix`](https://github.com/stooj/nix-config/blob/a676e03640450c38b25c2303ae11abce05abd413/vim.nix#L5) probably doesn't make sense any more. The question is: "how do I set the default for the root user? Do I manage the root user with home manager as well?"

Ugh, that means I need to either rethink `common`, or just decide that `common` isn't included for the root user. They will have minimal configuration anyway...

It's a problem for another day, right now I'll just remove it.

<!-- TODO Link to commit fba3b95 -->

This configuration is going to be in multiple parts, and kinda big, so I'm going to try to logically split it up. First step is to create a directory structure for the configuration and install neovim. Pindy doesn't use any kind of vi derivative so this will all live in `stooj`.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 1fed42c -->

Vim is still installed as a system package and if I'm in my user account I want `vim` to be an alias for `nvim`:

```
[stooj@drummer:~/code/nix/nix-config]$ readlink --canonicalize $(which vim)
/nix/store/ci04zrl659f8ci0ixps2nwr8nq4l08c0-vim-9.1.1122/bin/vim

[stooj@drummer:~/code/nix/nix-config]$ readlink --canonicalize $(which nvim)
/nix/store/31gmcik98f8bgl3blgy2i2dky87hfhnn-neovim-0.10.2/bin/nvim
```

<!-- TODO Link to commit 189de49 -->

```
[stooj@drummer:~]$ readlink --canonicalize $(which vim)
/nix/store/kjybnyrqdis57yv4qfprycd1xcqw44ky-neovim-0.10.2/bin/nvim

[stooj@drummer:~]$ readlink --canonicalize $(which nvim)
/nix/store/kjybnyrqdis57yv4qfprycd1xcqw44ky-neovim-0.10.2/bin/nvim
```

Be right back. Restarting my editor.

```vim
:wq
```

Time to get config-ing.

> !NOTE
> I'm going to be using a bunch of other people's configs for inspiration/ideas/solutions, but the big inspiration for the layout of the code is from [dc-tec](https://github.com/dc-tec/nixvim).

Line numbers first, and if you're not a vim user then an "unusual" setup straight out the gate.

The current line number is shown at the bottom a {,neo}vim window by default, along with the column number as well. That's handy, but I like to have the line numbers be a bit more obvious for myself and anyone looking over my shoulder.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 46ffc6c -->

We have line numbers. Wow, they're a bit difficult to see by default, huh?

<!-- TODO Insert image 34-neovim_with_line_numbers.png -->

> !Note
> I can't get over how cool kitty's hint thing is. Yanking commit hashes and filenames is *so* easy üòç

Uuughh... I didn't want to do this yet, but I need to. I can barely see the line numbers with the default colourscheme, so I need to change it. I do quite _like_ the defaults; its muted and chill, but the line numbers are muted so much they are basically invisible for me.

<!-- TODO Link to commit d2a6446 -->

<!-- TODO Insert image 34-neovim_with_gruvbox.png -->

That's better. It's still a little bit muted for all this sunshine I'm living in though.

Lets line up all three and see what they look like:

<!-- TODO Insert image 34-gruvbox_default.png -->
<!-- TODO Insert image 34-gruvbox_soft.png -->
<!-- TODO Insert image 34-gruvbox_hard.png -->

The hard's have it, but that turns out to be the default.

Oooh! What's `dim_inactive` though (from [the plugin readme](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim))?

<!-- TODO Insert image 34-gruvbox_no_dim.png -->
<!-- TODO Insert image 34-gruvbox_with_dim.png -->

Oooh, I like that!

<!-- TODO Link to commit 522c468 -->

Inactive windows will have gruvbox `soft`, active windows will use gruvbox `hard`.

I promised a strange configuration, and this all looks pretty normal so far. Here you go:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 1b97f07 -->

<!-- TODO Insert image 34-neovim_with_relative_numbers.png -->

With `relativenumber`, the _actual_ line number **only** shows on the line where the cursor is. The line above is "1", or "1 line above where you are at the moment". This means it's trivial to jump 6 lines up (`6k`) rather than going to line three (`:3`). It doesn't gain you much in such a small file but it's great for larger ones, and my brain thinks in these relative terms about line numbers. It makes it easier to count how many lines to delete or select or something too, although you have to remember to add 1 to the relative number shown (because you need to include the current number).

Anyway, something urgent has come up. I haven't set neovim as my default editor yet. Easily fixed.

<!-- TODO Link to commit f8dabc6 -->

While I'm here, I might as well set it as the default for `vimdiff` as well.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 46782a0 -->

I don't think I like the layout here though, I'd like `default.nix` to be an entrypoint for the configuration rather than having configuration itself.

Something like this:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 92e2b57 -->

Where to start? Lets make it easy to learn the things I'm going to configure by making the keybindings obvious with [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim), which shows a reference for keybindings as you type them. It's a utility thing, so I'm going to take a page out of [dc-tec's nixvim config](https://github.com/dc-tec/nixvim/tree/main) and make a `plugins/utils` directory.

Here's how you install a plugin with nixvim. How fecking cool and easy is that?

<!-- TODO Link to commit e9cc911 -->

Right, so which-key will now pop-up at the bottom if I press the first character of some command, showing me a list of all the things I _could_ press next and what they'll do.

<!-- TODO Insert image 34-which_key_after_g_key_pressed.png -->

Next is finding a way of opening files. A lot of people have a tree viewer plugin for this (actually, maybe that's a good idea for discovering the layout of a project) but I prefer opening files directly with fuzzy matching.

There's a plugin called Telescope which provides a generic "pick things from a list" interface that's lovely to use.

This is going to be a utility again - I'm somewhat worried that everything will end up in the `utils` directory.

This'll need some more configuration, but install the plugin first.

<!-- TODO Link to commit dd3608f -->

Hmm, that printed out a warning when I built it.
```
evaluation warning: Nixvim: `plugins.web-devicons` was enabled automatically because the following plugins are enabled.
  This behaviour is deprecated. Please explicitly define `plugins.web-devicons.enable` or alternatively
  enable `plugins.mini.enable` with `plugins.mini.modules.icons` and `plugins.mini.mockDevIcons`.
  plugins.telescope
```

What's [mini](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim)?

Hmm, looks handy for later ü§î. Wow, that's a lot of things though.

I definitely _want_ devicons, but I don't have a font that supports them yet. I'd meant to do this another day, but I guess we're doing it now. Time to install [nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

Nerd fonts are a collection of the fonts you probably wanted to use anyway, but with a veritable **mountain** of extra glyphs that mean you get fancy icons in your terminal.

For example, `\uf313` looks like nonsense at the moment: 

<!-- TODO Insert image 34-what_font_am_i_using.png -->

Wait, what? That looks fine! ü§î

And smileys work too!

Maybe the nix icon is a special case? What happens if I try to print an _incredibly obscure_ icon?

OK, so they didn't work. Weird. So let's explicitly install a font and set it as the default in kitty. But this isn't vim, so it's time for a new post.

```bash
cd ~/code/nix/nix-config
git checkout main
git merge vim
```
