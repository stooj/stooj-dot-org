Title: Markdown formatting

```bash
cd ~/code/nix/nix-config
git checkout -b markdown-formatting
```

I've got two repos on drummer at the moment, `nix-config` and `stooj-dot-org`. The nix one is sorted now, I've got a Nix LSP set up and conform is formatting it with `nixfmt`. On top of that, `treefmt` is able to format the whole repo using `nix fmt`, which of course uses `nixfmt`. Of course.

There's no markdown formatting though, and while, you know... it's just markdown, there are LSPs out there. I had a look at the [nvim-lspconfig list](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/configs.md) and I could see:

- [dprint](https://github.com/dprint/dprint): Pluggable and configurable code formatting platform written in Rust. It does markdown and a bunch of other things.
- [grammarly](https://github.com/znck/grammarly): Send your file to grammarly. Discontinued, and anyway no thanks.
- [harper_ls](https://github.com/automattic/harper): The Grammar Checker for Developers. Might be interesting to fix my writing words make better.
- [htmx](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/htmx-lsp): HTMLX but does markdown as well? From everyone's favourite Youtube superstar ThePrimeagen but I'm not writing [htmlx](https://htmx.org/) just now. 
- [ltex](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls): LTeX Language Server: LSP language server for LanguageTool üîç‚úîÔ∏è with support for LaTeX üéì, Markdown üìù, and others
- [ltex_plus](https://github.com/ltex-plus/ltex-ls-plus): Maybe a fork of ltex-ls?
- [markdown_oxide](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide): A Personal Knowledge Management language server. This looks _really_ interesting and might replace vimwiki for me. I'm not planning on using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) though.
- [marksman](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman): Write Markdown with code assist and intelligence in the comfort of your favourite editor.
- [prosemd_lsp](https://github.com/kitten/prosemd-lsp): An experimental proofreading and linting language server for markdown files ‚úçÔ∏è
- [remark_ls](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-language-server): A language server to lint and format markdown files with [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).
- [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense): Intelligent Tailwind CSS tooling. Apparently supports markdown, but probably not what I'm looking for.
- [tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist): Tinymist [Ààta…™ni m…™st] is an integrated language service for [Typst](https://typst.app/) [ta…™pst]. Woah, typst is a possible LaTeX replacement. That needs investigating.
- [unocss](https://github.com/xna00/unocss-language-server): A language server for unocss. I don't know what unocss is, so probably not useful to me just now.
- [vale_ls](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-ls): An implementation of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for the [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) command-line tool.
- [zk](https://github.com/zk-org/zk): A plain text note-taking assistant. Another vimwiki alternative. I should investigate some day.

Woah, there are a lot. I think I can narrow it down a bit though; I want two (actually three) things:

1. Code linting:
   - marksman
   - remark_ls
2. Grammar checking:
   - harper_ls
   - ltex
   - ltex_plus
   - prosemd_lsp
   - vale_ls
3. Third thing that I don't want to solve right this minute: code formatting (because that's for conform to fix)
   - dprint

## Code linting

### [Marksman](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman)

Oooh, this does link completion (fine) with anchor links (ü§©). It treats a project as anything with a `.git` directory.

### [Remark](https://remark.js.org/)

Lints and formats markdown files, and remark can also convert markdown to html (I'd usually use pandoc for that). It can generate tables of content too.

---

I'll try marksman first, it also supports wiki links which might be useful to me.

<!-- TODO Link to commit b30ddef -->

Quit _this_ vim window with a markdown file and reopen it again. No fidget spinner :(

Check `:LspLog`:

```
[START][2025-04-26 22:35:43] LSP logging initiated
[ERROR][2025-04-26 22:35:43] .../vim/lsp/rpc.lua:770	"rpc"	"/nix/store/dql5sz7187b7k0zq8ad1a1mmcy486891-marksman-2024-10-07/bin/marksman"	"stderr"	"[22:35:43 INF] <LSP Entry> Starting Marksman LSP server: {}\n"
```

Hmm, that doesn't tell me much. Marksman started but rpc is receiving an error?

Try running marksman with verbose logging turned on:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 7bb8c72 -->

Reading `:LspLog` now:

```
[START][2025-04-26 23:08:56] LSP logging initiated
[ERROR][2025-04-26 23:08:56] .../vim/lsp/rpc.lua:770	"rpc"	"/nix/store/dql5sz7187b7k0zq8ad1a1mmcy486891-marksman-2024-10-07/bin/marksman"	"stderr"	"[23:08:56 INF] <LSP Entry> Starting Marksman LSP server: {}\n"

... etc. ...
```

That's a lot of nothing. The LSP server looks like it's working fine, but everything is showing as errors.

There's an open issue in the nixvim issue tracker about a similar error with nixd. [This comment](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim/issues/2390#issuecomment-2408101568) suggests that it's unicode characters in the source files causing the issue.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 2a589bd -->

It didn't fix it for me though üòí.

OK, time to file a bug I think. First off, build a minimal example to check that it's not something to do with my configuration elsewhere:

<!-- TODO Link to commit a18afb4 -->

There's no `vim` alias any more, so I need to run `nvim 38-markdown_formatting.md`. Wow, I've come a long way since my vim sessions looked like this.

<!-- TODO Insert image 38-minimal_vim.png -->

Argh, no snippets any more either! :grin:

OK, what does `:LspLog` say?

```
[START][2025-04-27 15:03:05] LSP logging initiated
[ERROR][2025-04-27 15:03:05] .../vim/lsp/rpc.lua:770	"rpc"	"/nix/store/dql5sz7187b7k0zq8ad1a1mmcy486891-marksman-2024-10-07/bin/marksman"	"stderr"	"[15:03:05 INF] <LSP Entry> Starting Marksman LSP server: {}\n"
```

Still the same issue. There is [this issue in the marksman repo](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman/issues/236). There's a suggestion in [this thread](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman/issues/236#issuecomment-1646976548) that's worth trying.

<!-- TODO Link to commit ba5e80a -->

That thread also recommends [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting.

Wait... I've got a horrible suspicion.

> This is just the way nvim treats logs from the server, not an error per-se.

Is... is it not actually erroring? Has marksman been working fine all this time but there's nothing worthwhile to say?

What if I try a test bit of code and press `<S-k>` on the `[reference]` on the first line.

```markdown
See [reference].
[reference]: https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman "If you can see this then marksman is working"
```

<!-- TODO Insert image 38-working_marksman.png -->

Whoops. It was working after all üòä. Move along please.

I can get rid of that minimal reproduction directory:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 2197e91 -->

And I can get rid of the extra options I used for debugging:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 7e3fe75 -->

Phew. That was a journey. What's next? Ah, yes...

## Grammar checking

I've used grammar checkers before and I love the idea, but they always want to correct my grammar inside codeblocks which is _never_ what I want.

Let's have a look at these and see what's available.

### [harper_ls](https://writewithharper.com/)

Open source, on-device only, it **does** do grammar checking on code but only for comments (nice!) and the [list of languages](https://writewithharper.com/docs/integrations/language-server#Supported-Languages) includes `nix.` It's an Automattic project... :oof:. That gives me some pause, their [founder hasn't been showering themselves in glory recently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP_Engine#WordPress_dispute_and_lawsuit).

### [ltex](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/) and [ltex_plus](https://ltex-plus.github.io/ltex-plus/)

Based on the commit history, `ltex_plus` is a fork of `ltex` since the latter hasn't been updated in two years. Cool, that's a good reason for a fork and refreshingly lacking in any drama.

It looks very comprehensive, and a killer feature for me is that it supports [neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg), which lines up with my future plans very nicely.

It claims to have extensive documentation (great), but I can't find a way to search that documentation (boo). Apart from reading the source on GitHub, which works fine I suppose. It looks like it will [ignore markdown code blocks](https://ltex-plus.github.io/ltex-plus/settings.html#ltexmarkdownnodes) as well (with a little configuration).

### [prosemd_lsp](https://github.com/kitten/prosemd-lsp)

Marked as experimental, but hasn't seen a commit in 4 years. Nah.

### [vale_ls](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-ls)

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) also supports a lot of markup languages ([but not neorg](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/issues/652) üôÅ)

So, order of preference for trying these out is:

1. ltex_plus
2. vale_ls
3. harper_ls

### Back to ltex

The first hurdle for ltex_plus is that it's not available in nixvim. Well, not _yet_, it's available in the [main branch](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/plugins/lsp/servers/ltex_plus/index.html) but not in the version I'm using (nixos-24.11).

So let's leave that one for now, shall we?

### Vale is next

I don't like this `servers` word repeated. Fix that first.

<!-- TODO Link to commit 8f46320 -->

And turn on `vale_ls`:

<!-- TODO Link to commit 55d79f3 -->

`nixos-rebuild`, restart my neovim window and... there's an error.

```
LSP[vale_ls] missing field `Path` at line 4 column 1
```

That's because `vale` [requires a `.vale.ini`](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-ini) in the root of the project directory. Yuck! I might be working with other people's projects that don't _have_ one of them. And it's going to throw that error every time I open a markdown file? Nope. Or save a file?

<!-- TODO Insert image 38-vale_error_list.png -->

I guess we're on to harper then.
