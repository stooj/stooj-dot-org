## Writing style

All writing in the first person. I am writing this as my notes, not as instructions for someone else.
I can have bad jokes though.

## Posts to write

- Fix mouse focus for i3. I don't know what I'm doing but somehow I switch window focus sometimes.
- Configure git to `push.autoSetupRemote`
- Configure nix formatter (add `formatter = pkgs.nixfmt-rfc-style;` in flake and then run `nix fmt`)
- Screen locking


### Vim post TODO

- whichkey âœ“
- fuzzy finding
- git plugins
- surround
- matching brackets
- rainbow brackets
