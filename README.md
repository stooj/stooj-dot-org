## Writing style

All writing in the first person. I am writing this as my notes, not as instructions for someone else.
I can have bad jokes though.

## Posts to write

- Fix nextcloud sync, tmp directory doesn't exist
- stoo wiki
- Configure git to `push.autoSetupRemote`
- Configure nix formatter (add `formatter = pkgs.nixfmt-rfc-style;` in flake and then run `nix fmt`)
- Screen locking
- Weechat
- Matrix?
- Git forge
- install tree, eza, etc
- tmux
